!!! info "Audio Format Support"
    Only .mp3 files are supported at this time. Make sure all audio files are properly encoded and placed under assets/mp3/.

!!! info "Track Rotation"
    Tracks rotate automatically in order. The player includes play, pause, skip, and volume control functionality.

## Optional Album Art

If you'd like to show cover art or thumbnails per track, provide the `image` field:

```json

```

Image files should ideally be square (1:1 aspect ratio) and under 500KB for fast load times.
