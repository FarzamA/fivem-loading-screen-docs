!!! info "Audio Format Support"
    Only .mp3 files are supported at this time. Make sure all audio files are properly encoded and placed under assets/mp3/.

!!! info "Track Rotation"
    Tracks rotate automatically in order. The player includes play, pause, skip, and volume control functionality.

## Optional Album Art

If you'd like to show cover art or thumbnails per track, provide the `image` field:

```json
"image": "./assets/path/to/cover_art.png"
```

Image files should ideally be square (1:1 aspect ratio) and under 500KB for fast load times.

## Optional Default Volume Setting

To set the initial volume level of the music player, add the following entry to your config:

```json
"defaultVolume": 100
```

This value accepts a number from 0 to 100, representing the percentage volume on first load.

    To disable the music player, simply remove the music entry or ensure the array contains no entries.
